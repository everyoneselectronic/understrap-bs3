About
=
Updated Understrap BS3 theme

Basic Features
=
- Combines the _s WordPress Starter Theme PHP/JS files and Bootstrap´s HTML/CSS/JS
- Comes with Bootstrap (3.3.7)
- Uses a single and minified CSS file for all the basic stuff
- Font Awesome Icon Font integrated (V 4.7.0): http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
- Comes with extra slider script - By owl.carousel (V 2.2.1): http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/
- Simple RTL file
- Jetpack ready

- Translation ready

Starter Theme + HTML Framework = WordPress Theme Framework
=
The _s theme is a good starting point to develope a WordPress theme. But it is "just" a raw starter theme. Means it outputs all the WordPress stuff correctly but without any layout or design.
Why don´t add a well known and supported layout framework to have a solid, clean and responsive foundation? Thats where Bootstrap comes in.

Installation
=
- Download the understrap folder
- Upload it into your WordPress installation subfolder here: /wp-content/themes/
- Login to your WordPress backend 
- Go to Appearance -> Themes
- Activate the UnderStrap theme

How to use the build-in Widget Slider?
=
The frontpage slider is widget driven. Simply add more than one widget to widget position "Hero".
- Click on Appearance -> Widgets 
- Add two or more widgets of any kind to widget area "Hero"
- Thats it
